# WheeStat6_0e
Improved user interface for WheeStat potentiostats.
User interface written in Processing program (www.processing.org).
This interface allows zooming of data regions, improved some of the bugs in the older software.  See youtube demo of zooming feature here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50kaD7aS9NQ.  Analysis software demo'd in the video is not included in this repository, it should be available in the WheeStatAnalysis1 repository.
A new item in this repository is the building instructions for the WheeStat 7.  I dont like selling the kits because people screw them up and then I need to troubleshoot what they have done wrong over the internet.  Anyway, that is in there.  
Good luck
